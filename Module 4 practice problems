#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False. Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)
# A  B  (A AND B) (NOT B) (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
#---------------------------------------------------------
# True   True     True        False          True
# True   False    False       True           True
# False  True     False       False          False
# False  False    False       True           True


#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
sensor_threshold = float(input("Enter the sensor threshold: "))
if sensor_threshold < 8:
    print("Headlights On")
else:
    print("Headlights Off")


#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100. Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.
balance = float(input("Enter your bank balance: $"))

if balance < 100:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)


#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age, and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17), or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 13:
    print("You can see G rated movies.")
elif 13 <= age <= 17:
    print("You can see PG-13 rated movies.")
else:
    print("You can see R rated movies.")

#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
#user total
order_total = float(input("Enter the order total: $"))

# fixate for free shipping
if order_total >= 50:
    shipping_cost = 0
else:
    shipping_cost = 5

# Calc
total_cost = order_total + shipping_cost

# Print the total cost
print(f"The total cost, including shipping, is: ${total_cost:.2f}")
