# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.
#1st user input
word = input("Enter a word:")

#2nd ask user for how many times to repeat a phrase or word
num_repeats =int(input("How many times would you like that word repeated?"))

#3rd print the word given by the user the number of times given
print(word * num_repeats)


#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."

# Prompt the user for their name and age
name = input("What is your name?")
age = int(input("How old are you?"))
# Calculate their age next year
next_year_age = age + 1
# calculation to print final message
print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old. Next year, you will be " + str(next_year_age) + " years old.")


#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)
#input
sentence = input("Enter a sentence:")
word = input("Enter a word:")
#input for possible word
word_found = word in sentence
#print if word is found or not
print(word_found)


#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.
# Get inputs from the user
word = input("Enter a word: ")
first_index = int(input("Enter the first index: "))
last_index = int(input("Enter the last index: "))

# Slice the word and print the outcome
print(word[first_index:last_index])


#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.
words = ("Hello", "everybody", "whatup")
print("|".join(words))
