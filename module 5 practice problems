#1. Prompt the user for a positive integer n. Use a while loop to sum all the integers from 1 up to n. Print the final sum.
counter = 1
sum = 0
while counter <= 50:
    sum + counter
    print("counter = ", counter, "; sum =", sum)
    counter +=1
    print(sum)

#2. Define a string variable (e.g., my_string = "Olympic College"). Use a for loop to print each character on its own line. Convert each character to uppercase before printing.
my_string = "Olympic College"

for char in my_string:
    print(char.upper())

#3. Use a for loop and the range() function to print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
#even numbers
for i in range(2, 21, 2):
 print(i)

#4. Use nested for loops to create a simple multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5. Format your output so that each row corresponds to multiplying by a specific number. Example output:
# Create the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5
for number in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        #outcome
        print(f"{number*j}", end="\t")  # Using '\t' (t)= spacing
    print()  # row to row (outcome)

#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:
while True:
    user_input = int(input("Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): "))

    if user_input == 0:
        break
    else:
        print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
