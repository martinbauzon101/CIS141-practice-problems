#1. Given a list of numbers, write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.
#input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#variable for list
even_sum = sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)
#print sentence
print("Sum of even numbers:", even_sum)

#2. With a list of strings provided, write code that counts how many times the word "Olympic" appears in the list, and then print the count.
# List of strings
strings = ["New york", "Port Angles", "Winter Olympics Sports", "Olympic gold medal", "Olympic College"]

# look for the word Olympic (count)
count = 0

# endpoint
for string in strings:
    # Count how many times "Olympic" appears in each string
    count += string.lower().count("olympic")

#print
print("The word 'Olympic' appears", count, "times.")

#3. Given a list of strings, write code to create a new list that includes only the strings longer than three characters. Print the resulting filtered list.
# List/string
strings = ["Supreme","of","generate","to","Again!","A","clock","Pay"]

# 2nd List/string
filtered_strings = [string for string in strings if len(string) > 3]

# Print result
print("Filtered list:", filtered_strings)

#4. For a list of integers, write code that counts how many numbers are positive and how many are negative, then print both counts.
# List of numbers
numbers = [3, -1, 5, -7, 2, -4, 8, -3]

#  "settings"
positive_count = sum(1 for num in numbers if num > 0)
negative_count = sum(1 for num in numbers if num < 0)

# print count
print("Positive numbers:", positive_count)
print("Negative numbers:", negative_count)

#5. For a list of integers, use a loop to build a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original list. Print the new list.
#input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#new list with element
squared_numbers = []

for num in numbers:
    squared_numbers.append(num ** 2)

# result
print("Squared numbers:", squared_numbers)
